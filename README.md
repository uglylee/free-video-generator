# Free Video Generator — Completely Free AI Video Generator


> **Completely free AI video generator** — Built on Agnes AI's free models, no subscription, no high-end GPU, no usage limits. Type in a text idea and automatically generate multi-scene AI videos with narration and subtitles. Supports text-to-video, image-to-video, keyframes animation, digital anchor, and more. All AI compute runs in the cloud — a regular laptop is all you need. **[Try it online →](https://video.lichuanyang.top)**

> "The solution is not to suppress AI, but to make it a more equitable capability, so that everyone knows how to create more with AI. This is a very important vision for our company — to make world-class AI belong to everyone. What we can do may be insignificant, but this vision is very long-term and enduring."
>
> — Bruce Yang, Founder of Agnes AI


## Why Free Video Generator?

Making AI videos today has an absurdly high barrier. Overseas services like Runway and Pika charge monthly subscriptions of tens of dollars. Domestic platforms like Jimeng and Keling charge by the second once their free quotas run out. Want to run open-source models locally? A GPU capable of video generation easily costs over ten thousand RMB. For most people who want to try AI video creation, the door is essentially closed.

We believe what Bruce Yang said — AI should be a more equitable capability. World-class AI should belong to everyone, not just those who can afford the bill.

To be honest, Agnes's video model isn't perfect yet. The generated frames are sometimes unstable, and complex actions occasionally deform. But it is **completely free with no usage limits**, and it iterates fast. We choose to grow with it rather than wait for a "perfect" commercial solution. If you share this mindset, then this project is for you — all you need is a free [Agnes AI](https://platform.agnes-ai.com) API key and an ordinary computer that can run Python to start creating AI videos at zero cost.

## Core Features

### Multiple Creation Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Simple Video** | Single prompt → single AI video. Full control over all parameters (generation mode, duration, resolution, seed, negative prompt). Also supports image-to-video and keyframes mode. | Quick single-clip AI video |
| **Creative Video** | Full AI pipeline: idea → story → script → character reference → multi-scene video → narration → subtitles → final output. 10-step pipeline, fully automated. | Storytelling, creative videos |
| **Manuscript Video** | Paste a long article or script → auto-split by reading duration → per-segment AI video → unified TTS narration + subtitle overlay → final output. 5-step pipeline. | Explainers, course content, vlogs |
| **Digital Anchor** | AI-generated digital anchor (or upload custom image) → dynamic anchor clip → TTS narration → subtitle positioning → looped concatenation. Optional reference image for appearance consistency. | Virtual anchors, product presentations, news broadcasts |

### Completely Free AI Model Chain

All core AI capabilities are **completely free** — no trial period, no watermarks, no token limits:

| Capability | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Text / Script Generation | `agnes-2.0-flash` | Free |
| Image Generation | `agnes-image-2.1-flash` | Free |
| Video Generation | `agnes-video-v2.0` | Free |
| Text-to-Speech Narration | Edge TTS (Microsoft) | Free, no extra API key needed |

All AI API calls share a global token bucket rate limiter (16 requests/min), with automatic retries and exponential backoff to ensure stable operation.

### AI Narration & Smart Subtitles

Both Creative Video and Manuscript Video support:

- **Free TTS narration**: Based on Microsoft Edge TTS, offering 4 Chinese voice roles (gentle female, steady male, lively female, young male) with adjustable speech rate (-30% to +30%)
- **Word-level fine-grained subtitles**: SRT subtitles generated from TTS word-level timestamps, one entry every 2-3 seconds, with precise audio-video sync
- **Multi-line auto-wrapping**: Long subtitle text is intelligently split into two lines, preferring punctuation break points to prevent screen overflow
- **Fully configurable subtitle style**: Font, color, size, position (top/bottom), stroke, and semi-transparent background
- **Audio-video sync strategy**: All video clips are concatenated first, then audio and subtitles are overlaid as a whole, avoiding cumulative errors from per-segment overlay. TTS output is automatically amplified 2.5x to compensate for Edge TTS's low default volume

### Flexible Creative Controls

- **Custom reference images** — Upload character or scene reference images to maintain visual consistency across scenes
- **Custom end frames** — Specify end frame images per scene for precise visual transition control
- **Image-to-image end frames** — Auto-generate scene end frames via img2img from your reference image
- **Three video chaining modes** — `keyframes` (first+last frame interpolation, recommended) / `ti2vid` (inter-scene transition frames) / `none` (independent scenes)
- **Multiple resolutions** — Portrait 9:16 (768x1152), Landscape 16:9 (1152x768), Square 1:1 (1024x1024)
- **Flexible duration** — Custom scene duration
- **Smart manuscript splitting** — Splits by period/question mark/exclamation mark, greedily merges into 5-12 second segments based on reading speed (~4 chars/sec), preserves long sentences, auto-merges short sentences forward

### Production-Grade Reliability

- **Checkpoint resume** — Automatically resumes from the last checkpoint after interruption; state is persisted after each step, no duplicate API calls
- **Task management** — Create, view, resume, and stop tasks from the Web UI
- **Real-time progress** — WebSocket pushes per-step generation progress (step name, status, percentage, current/total)
- **Built-in CJK fonts** — Project ships with Chinese fonts, no garbled characters in subtitle rendering

### AI Agent Friendly

Designed specifically for AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.), with a complete `AGENTS.md` deployment guide. AI Agents can automatically:

- Check environment (Python 3.10+, ffmpeg)
- Install dependencies and start the server
- Configure API key
- Run 4-layer deployment verification (connectivity → static analysis → endpoint testing → subtitle feature)
- Execute 10-scenario regression test suite

### Multilingual Web UI

One-click launch, operate entirely in the browser. Interface available in **7 languages**: Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- ffmpeg (for video concatenation and audio processing)

That's it. No GPU, no large RAM, a regular laptop is all you need.

### Option A: Manual Setup

**Step 1 — Clone & Launch**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uglylee/free-video-generator.git
cd free-video-generator
./start.sh
```

The script automatically creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and opens `http://localhost:8765` in your browser. You can also start manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python server.py
```

**Step 2 — Configure API Key**

Get a free API key from [Agnes AI](https://platform.agnes-ai.com), then choose one of two ways:

```bash
# Way 1: Environment variable
export AGNES_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Way 2: Via API (same as entering it in the Web UI)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api_key": "your-api-key"}'
```

**Step 3 — Create Your First Video**

Open `http://localhost:8765`, choose a video mode (Simple / Creative / Manuscript / Anchor), enter your idea, and click "Start Generating".

### Option B: AI Agent Assisted Setup

This project is designed for AI coding assistants. First, download the code and prepare your API key:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uglylee/free-video-generator.git
cd free-video-generator
```

Then tell your agent:

> "Read the AGENTS.md in this project, install dependencies, configure the API key `<your-key>`, and start the server."

The agent will read `AGENTS.md` (a comprehensive deployment guide) and handle: environment checks (Python 3.10+, ffmpeg), `pip install`, server launch, and API key configuration. After startup, you can also ask the agent to verify the deployment:

> "Run the deployment verification checks."

The agent will execute the 4-layer checklist from `AGENTS.md` (connectivity → static analysis → endpoint testing → subtitle feature) and report results.

## FAQ

### Is Free Video Generator really free? Are there any hidden costs?

Yes, it is **completely free**. All AI model calls (Agnes Chat, Agnes Image, Agnes Video) are free of charge with no trial period, no watermarks, and no usage limits. The only TTS integration (Microsoft Edge TTS) is also free and requires no extra API key. You only need a free API key from [Agnes AI](https://platform.agnes-ai.com) to get started.

### Do I need a GPU to run this AI video generator?

No. All AI compute runs in the cloud via Agnes AI's free API. You just need a regular laptop or desktop computer that can run Python 3.10+ and ffmpeg. No GPU, no high RAM, no special hardware required.

### How is this different from Runway, Pika, or Sora?

Unlike commercial AI video tools that charge $10-$95/month, Free Video Generator is completely free and open-source (MIT). It offers built-in multi-scene pipelines, AI narration, auto subtitles, and digital anchor — features that require third-party tools or manual editing elsewhere. See the [comparison table](#comparison-free-video-generator-vs-commercial-ai-video-tools) above for details.

### What video generation modes are supported?

Four modes: **Simple Video** (single prompt, full parameter control), **Creative Video** (AI story → multi-scene video with narration), **Manuscript Video** (long text → auto-split → narrated video), and **Digital Anchor** (AI anchor with TTS). Additional options include text-to-video, image-to-video, keyframes animation, and image-to-image end frame generation.

### Can I use my own images as references?

Yes. You can upload reference images for character or scene consistency across scenes, use custom end frames for precise visual transitions, or choose img2img to auto-generate end frames from your reference. Reference images are supported in both Creative Video and Digital Anchor modes.

### What languages does the UI support?

The Web UI supports 7 languages: Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Bahasa Melayu, and Bahasa Indonesia. Subtitles are generated in the source text language with CJK font support built-in.

### Can I host this on my own server?

Absolutely. The project is designed for self-hosting. Just clone the repo, run `./start.sh`, and the server starts on `http://localhost:8765`. No external dependencies, no cloud lock-in. See the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above.

### How do I get help or report issues?

Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/uglylee/free-video-generator/issues) page for existing reports or open a new one. The project also includes a comprehensive `AGENTS.md` for AI-agent-assisted debugging. For feature requests, bug reports, or questions, the Issues page is the best place.
